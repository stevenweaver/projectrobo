<div class="objective">
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
       To design and build a robot that can autonomously navigate around a predetermined course in the shortest amount of time possible. 
       The course will cover areas with usable GPS signals as-well-as GPS denied environments.
       Navigation beacons/waypoints will be placed on the course to aid in navigation and score the robot's progress.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="project_overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
    The construction of a robot capable of autonomous navigation will require the use of many different engineering disciplines.
    The robot will need to invorporate several different sensor systems in order to avoid obstacles and navigate its way through the course.
    The sensors may require the development of analog instrumentation to amplify and filter signals prior to digitizing them for use by a central controller.
    The locomotion and control of the vehicle will require the design of power electronics capable of driving motors in either direction at varying speeds.
    An embedded central processor will be required for mission control. 
    This central controller will be required to collect the various sensor data, make decisions about the trajectory the robot should take, and deliver that information to the motion control system.
    </p>
    <p>
    A budget of $750 will be available for discretionary parts needed for the construction of the robot. 
    Additionally, various drive train components, microcontroller and FPGA development hardware will be provided to each team.
    </p>
</div>
<div class="project_requirements">
    <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The robot must be a self contained autonomous vehicle. No human or remote server interaction is permitted.
        </li>
        <li>
            The entire vehicle at deployment must fit within a 16"x16"x16" cube. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The robot must have a clearly labeled emergency stop switch. 
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="course">
    <h2>Course</h2>
    <p>
       The course start, finish, and way points will be disclosed at least 48 hours before the competition.
       The course will contain five waypoints with navigation assist beacons.   
    </p>

</div>
<div class="beacons">
    <h2>Beacons</h2>
    <p>
       The beacons represent waypoints that the vehicles must navigate through in order to complete a leg of teh course.
       The beacons emit ultrasonic energy and RF data packets in order to assist the robots in locating and identifying the individual waypoints.
    </p>

</div>
<div class="scoring">
    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
        The contest will be scored based on a number of different criteria ranging from static judging to performance on the course.
        The following is the proposed scoring, which is similar to what was used in the 2006 Robotic Navigator challenge.
        The scoring criteria for the 2010 challenge will be finalized by a vote of the participating teams. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Static Judging(50 pts)</b>- Each robot will be evaluated on the merits of its design and construction. 
                Points will be awarded based on design, innovation, and quality of craftsmanship.
            </li> 
            <li>
                <b>Performance Analysis(Variable Points)</b> - Each team will be permitted to make at least three attempts at completing the course.
                The total point score from the best run will be used. The course is broken up into 5 consecultive legs. Each leg of the course will be worth (10 points + 1000 * 1/t in seconds) points).
                A bounus of 1/2 of the previous leg's total score(including any bonuses) will be provided for completing multiple segments of the course sequentially.
                The team may choose at any time to give up on a segment of the course and place their robot under the beacon marking the beginning of the next segment of the course.
           </li>
