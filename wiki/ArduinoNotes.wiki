#summary Notes on the arduino code

= Introduction =
The arduino is surprisingly pleasant to work with. These are some notes for the code.


= Details =

The main code is in serial called serial.pde. This will interface with all of the sensors we are receiving.

===FLEX===
The flex pin corresponds to Analog IN 0

For the flex sensors, you need to use a voltage divider. (Very much like project 2 of the senior lab).

The flex sensor standing up is 8k, bent it was something like 20k. 

using 15k resistor

|| *Flex* || *standing up* || *something bad is happening* ||*emergency* || *OMG WTF we're dead* ||
|| 1 || 653 || <570 || <500 || <450 ||
|| 2 || 603 || <530 || <450 || <400 ||


===SONAR===

The sonar sensor corresponds to pin 7 of the PWM side. 

===COMPASS===
For the compass. You must use pins 20 and 21 under Communication. pin 20 is for the data pin SDA and 21 is for SCL, as marked.
