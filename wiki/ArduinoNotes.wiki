#summary Notes on the arduino code

= Introduction =
The arduino is surprisingly pleasant to work with. These are some notes for the code.


= Details =

The main code is in serial called serial.pde. This will interface with all of the sensors we are receiving.

Some notes:
The flex pin corresponds to Analog IN 0

The sonar sensor corresponds to pin 7 of the PWM side. 

For the compass. You must use pins 20 and 21 under Communication. pin 20 is for the data pin SDA and 21 is for SCL, as marked.
