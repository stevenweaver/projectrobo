#summary Notes on the arduino code

= Introduction =
The arduino is surprisingly pleasant to work with. These are some notes for the code.


= Details =

The main code is in serial called serial.pde. This will interface with all of the sensors we are receiving.

===FLEX===
The flex pin corresponds to Analog IN 0

For the flex sensors, you need to use a voltage divider. (Very much like project 2 of the senior lab).

For the noobs: the equation is (Vref)*(R2/R1+R2)
The flex sensor standing up is 8k, bent it was something like 20k. 

using 15k resistor

flex 1:

653 standing up

<570 means something bad happening

<500 EMERGENCY

<450 OMG WTF we're dead

flex 2:

603 standing up

<530 something bad happening

<450 EMERGENCY

<400 OMG WTF we're dead


===SONAR===

The sonar sensor corresponds to pin 7 of the PWM side. 

===COMPASS===
For the compass. You must use pins 20 and 21 under Communication. pin 20 is for the data pin SDA and 21 is for SCL, as marked.
